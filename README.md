perfect-number-finder
=====================

This ruby program takes a range from high to low and returns whether it is
perfect or not.  A **perfect number**, when all of its
divisors are added together and divided by 2, equal to itself.

Examples include:
----------------
**6** (divisors: 6, 3, 2, 1) 6+3+2+1 = 12/2 = 6

**28** (28, 14, 7, 4, 2, 1)


Methods:
-------
* get_factors (gets all factors of a number)
* sum_array (adds all factors together)
* perfect_check (calls other methods and checks result)
